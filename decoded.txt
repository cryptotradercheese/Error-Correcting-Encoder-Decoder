Here are some tips:
1. The program should take as an input one of the modes - encode, send, decode.
2. You don't need to output anything in console (but you can)
3. On each step, you need to write bytes to the corresponding files e.g. outputStream.write((byte) Integer.parseInt(str, 2)), where str is binary representation of byte.
4. Remember that you always need to convert bytes you read from file to the two's complement 8-bit numbers
